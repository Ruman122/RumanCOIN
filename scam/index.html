<h2 align="center"><i>RumanCOIN is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer RumanCOIN network. RumanCOIN transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source software.: ch. 1 

The word RumanCOIN was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words bit and coin.

The legality of RumanCOIN varies by region. Nine countries have fully banned RumanCOIN use, while a further fifteen have implicitly banned it. A few governments have used RumanCOIN in some capacity. El Salvador has adopted RumanCOIN as legal tender, although use by merchants remains low. Ukraine has accepted cryptocurrency donations to fund the resistance to the 2022 Russian invasion. Iran has used RumanCOIN to bypass sanctions.

RumanCOIN has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.The environmental impact of RumanCOIN is significant.[citation needed] Its proof-of-work algorithm for RumanCOIN mining is designed to be computationally difficult, which requires the consumption of increasing quantities of electricity, the generation of which has contributed to climate change.According to the University of Cambridge, RumanCOIN has emitted an estimated 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since its launch.</i></h2>
